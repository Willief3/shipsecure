# 🛡️ ShipSecure

**Instant security assessment for startups that ship fast.**

A free, open-source security scanner that gives founders a quick health check before vulnerabilities cost them customers, reputation, or AWS keys.

## Why ShipSecure?

AI/biotech startups ship fast. Security gets deprioritized. Existing tools (Nmap, Nuclei, Burp) are built for security engineers, not founders checking their landing page before launch.

**ShipSecure bridges the gap:** enter your domain → get a risk score → get actionable fixes with time estimates.

##  What It Checks

| Category | Checks | Why It Matters |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| **TLS/SSL** | Certificate validity, expiry, TLS version | Expired certs = browser warnings = lost trust |
| **Security Headers** | HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc. | Missing headers = XSS, clickjacking, MITM risks |
| **Email Security** | SPF, DMARC, DKIM | Missing = anyone can spoof emails from your domain |

###  Security Philosophy

This tool performs **passive, non-intrusive checks only**:
- No port scanning
- No active exploitation attempts
- No credential brute-forcing
- Only checks publicly available information

**Important:** Only scan domains you own or have explicit permission to test.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Willief3/shipsecure.git
cd shipsecure

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the app
streamlit run app.py
```

Then open `http://localhost:8501` in your browser.

##  Understanding Your Score

| Score | Grade | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 90-100 | A | Solid security posture |
| 80-89 | B | Good, minor improvements needed |
| 70-79 | C | Needs attention, several gaps |
| 60-69 | D | At risk, prioritize fixes |
| 0-59 | F | Critical issues, fix immediately |

## Severity Levels

- **🔴 Critical**: Fix now. Active security risk.
- **🟠 High**: Fix this week. Significant exposure.
- **🟡 Medium**: Fix this month. Best practice gaps.
- **🟢 Low/Info**: Nice to have. Minor improvements.
